Deep Q-Learning for Atari Breakout

Kafkalias A., Papayiannis K., Theodosiou M. Department of Computer Science University of Bath2021

We present a deep reinforcement learning model that learns to play the arcadegame \textit{Breakout}.  Our agent is trained on the OpenAI Gym environment using avariant of Deep Q-Learning and a convolutional neural network that takes imagesof the game as input and outputs the expected reward for each action. We find thatour model performs 500% better than the average human score and receives analmost perfect score for the best runs.  We compare our model against a secondagent trained using the console RAM as input, and suggest several improvementsto further increase scores and decrease training times.
